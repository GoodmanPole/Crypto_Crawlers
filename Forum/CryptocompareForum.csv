Having Mars by its side, can be very volatile. <br/>On June 1st, Mars will be squaring Bitcoin’s Mars exactly, which is bearish after a local top during the new Moon on the 30th of May.<br/>On the 2nd of June, Venus will trine Bitcoin’s Mars, on the 8th, Venus will trine Bitcoin’s Sun; and on the 10th, Venus will trine Bitcoin’s Uranus. All those are supportive aspects for Bitcoin.<br/>On the 12th, Mars will square Bitcoin’s Sun. This might be a challenge.<br/>Venus – value - squaring Uranus, which means instability in the markets. <br/>On the 15th, Venus will be trineing Bitcoin’s retrograde Saturn. Saturn means support or support levels. Let’s hope this will give us some support during the Full Moon in Saggitarius on the 14-15 of June. <br/>On the 16th, Venus will square Bitcoin’s Neptune – Euphoria in the markets !!! <br/>The markets can be very shaky between June 18 and 19.<br/>On the 21st, the Sun will trine Bitcoin’s Venus, again a positive aspect.<br/>On the 22nd, the Sun will trine Bitcoin’s Jupiter and be opposite Bitcoin’s Pluto. Well, I see this as a lot of green and then... …. Ups! ….. wtf just happened? <br/>On the 28th, the New Moon in Cancer can be a very challenging local top, because, with Mars squaring Bitcoin’s Jupiter, the market is very volatile. <br/><br/>https://i.postimg.cc/j510N0ZM/85bff4b2-14f0-44a6-8129-bdef879a512d.jpg<br/><br/>General reading in the comments section bellow<br/><br/>Made with &#129505;<br/>bb1010",,0,0
